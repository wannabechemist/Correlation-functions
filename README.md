# correlation-functions
An attachment to my master thesys (titled Screening of ionic interactions in a charged adsorbent - the application of Replica Ornstein-Zernike equations)
which allows the intrested user access to the code I used to generate animations of the derived correlation functions 
as well as the animations themselves. The code is written in python, using the matplotlib lybrary.
The names of the animation files relate to the images in the article Screening of ion–ion correlations in electrolyte solutions adsorbed
in electroneutral disordered matrices of charged particles: Application of replica Ornstein–Zernike equations. For axample animation q11_4(Q=0,7).gif 
is the animation of q11 correlation functions with the same parameters used as in fig.4 within the article with Q being 0,7. 
The full lines represent the correlation functions for the templated system in my master thesys, the dotted lines are for the correlation functions 
of the electroneutral adsorbent (refered to as electroneutral system by the authors themselves)  from the above mentioned article. The thesys as well as the animations are in Slovene.
